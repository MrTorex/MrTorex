### Hello!

My name is Aliaksiei, but you can know me as MrTorex. I'm studying in BSUIR. My speciality is game design.

Currently I'm learning such languages as C/C++, C#, Python, Javascript, etc.

My main goal is to create something really cool and new in the sphere of games. It's my dream since I've been 10 y.o.

I have a lot of experience in creating easy games in Clickteam Fusion Developer, some visual novels in Ren'Py and Unity.

I'm youtuber and streamer. Also I create music in such genres as Synthwave, Electronic, Orchestral and Rock.

Thank you for reading this!
